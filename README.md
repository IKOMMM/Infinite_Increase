# Infinite Increase (WebGL)
## Infinite Increase (Project Boost) Unity Game Repository
Based on the completed course Gamedev.tv - Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D

**Original concept:** Mini game about flying a spaceship on different scenes.
Learning elements such as: adding force in unity, rotation, input system and much more.

**Project extension:** Rebuilding the game into an endlessrunner.
I changed the design, added infinite gameplay with running out of fuel.
